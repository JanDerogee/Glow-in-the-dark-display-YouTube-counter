# Glow-in-the-dark-display-YouTube-counter-
This display is based on glow-in-the-dark (Phosphorescent) tape that is illuminated by UV-LED's. The LED's are driven by an ESP8266, which get's the time from an NTP server and requests the YouTube stats from the desried channel. That information is being "imprinted" on the tape with UV-light by the LED's which make it all work like a huger glow in the dark display.
