# Glow-in-the-dark-display-YouTube-counter-
This display is based on glow-in-the-dark (Phosphorescent) tape wrapped onto a roll that can rotate. That roll is is illuminated by row of UV-LED's capable of writing one single line of dot's onto the roll. Then the roll is rotated one line and the next line can be "written". After a lines of pixels a single row of characters is complete and ready for display.

The LED's are driven by an ESP8266, which get's the time from an NTP server and requests the YouTube stats from the desried channel.That information is being "imprinted" on the tape with UV-light by the LED's which make it all work like a huger glow in the dark display.
